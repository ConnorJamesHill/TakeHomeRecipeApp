### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I chose to focus manily on the core functionality of the app. There were several features that were asked for and I figured I would at bare minimum need those to work properly. I made sure to focus
on testing a lot in order to accomplish this. Testing was also explicitly mentioned in the assignment, which reinforced my choice in approach. It should be noted as well that I made certain that
all 3 states of the app (no data, error, normal) were quickly accessed and shown for you to check out. The eye button is of course used for debugging purposes and would not be present on the App Store version.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I took around 4 hours to fully complete this project including this line of question I am answering here.
I spent the first 30 minutes or so opening past projects and assimilating code I created there into this. I had just uploaded a similar app to the App Store that uses the google books api which
of ocurse utilizes cover photos and detailed book info, so that was very helpful. I then spent a couple hours mannaging the structure of the app, testing the api calls, make sure that I pushed
as much logic as I could into the ViewModels and that everything was clean and readable. I spent the final hour and a half answering these questions and creating plenty of comments as I
refactored as much of the project as I though made sense!

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
There was definitely a trade off that I was making with time and quality in terms of the visual appeal of the app. Most of my apps have really nice visuals that interest the user (I hope), but given
that there is some expectation of completing this project in a reasonable amount of time, I had to make sure that the app produced maximum functionality and neglect the visual appeal of it for now.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I would say that the app stands to improve visually in countless ways. Although it is functional and abides by apples standards of design for an app, it is very bland and simplistic. Also, I neglected
to make it so that the refresh button and the state toggle button cannot be tapped repeatedly. A third concern is that we made it so that images can be loaded locally after first doing so, but there
was no requirement to do the same for the rest of the api data. Making this app fully localized seems like an obvious next step towards removing a weakness, especially considering the alternative to
recipe apps and their direct competitor--recipe books-- which of course require no internet to utilize!

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
There is a lot to know! I left tons of comments throuhgout my code to explain my thought process further. Other than that, I would like to thank you for the opportunity, and I hope to show you more of
what I have to offer very soon! Thank you.
